## Training and test sets

```{r traintest, fig.height=1, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
train <- 1:18
test <- 19:24
par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0))
plot(0, 0, xlim = c(0, 26), ylim = c(0, 2), xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", bty = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", type = "n")
arrows(0, 0.5, 25, 0.5, 0.05)
points(train, train * 0 + 0.5, pch = 19, col = "#0072B2")
points(test, test * 0 + 0.5, pch = 19, col = "#D55E00")
text(26, 0.5, "time")
text(10, 1, "Training data", col = "#0072B2")
text(21, 1, "Test data", col = "#D55E00")
```

-   A model which fits the training data well will not necessarily forecast well.
-   A perfect fit can always be obtained by using a model with enough parameters.
-   Over-fitting a model to data is just as bad as failing to identify a systematic pattern in the data.
  * The test set must not be used for *any* aspect of model development or calculation of forecasts.
  * Forecast accuracy is based only on the test set.

## Forecast errors

Forecast "error": the difference between an observed value and its forecast.
$$
  e_{T+h} = y_{T+h} - \hat{y}_{T+h|T},
$$
where the training data is given by $\{y_1,\dots,y_T\}$

- Unlike residuals, forecast errors on the test set involve multi-step forecasts.
- These are *true* forecast errors as the test data is not used in computing $\hat{y}_{T+h|T}$.

## Measures of forecast accuracy

```{r beer-fc-1, echo=FALSE, fig.height=4}
train <- aus_production |>
  filter(between(year(Quarter), 1992, 2007))
beer <- aus_production |>
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 1992)
beer_fc_plot <- train |>
  model(
    Mean = MEAN(Beer),
    Naive = NAIVE(Beer),
    Seasonal_naive = SNAIVE(Beer),
    Drift = RW(Beer ~ drift())
  ) |>
  forecast(h = 11) |>
  autoplot(beer, level = NULL) +
  labs(
    title = "Forecasts for quarterly beer production",
    y = "Megalitres"
  ) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Forecast"))
beer_fc_plot
```

## Measures of forecast accuracy

\begin{tabular}{rl}
$y_{T+h}=$ & $(T+h)$th observation, $h=1,\dots,H$ \\
$\pred{y}{T+h}{T}=$ & its forecast based on data up to time $T$. \\
$e_{T+h} =$  & $y_{T+h} - \pred{y}{T+h}{T}$
\end{tabular}

\begin{block}{}\vspace*{-0.2cm}
\begin{align*}
\text{MAE} &= \text{mean}(|e_{T+h}|) \\[-0.2cm]
\text{MSE} &= \text{mean}(e_{T+h}^2) \qquad
&&\text{RMSE} &= \sqrt{\text{mean}(e_{T+h}^2)} \\[-0.1cm]
\text{MAPE} &= 100\text{mean}(|e_{T+h}|/ |y_{T+h}|)
\end{align*}\end{block}\pause\vspace*{-0.2cm}

  * MAE, MSE, RMSE are all scale dependent.
  * MAPE is scale independent but is only sensible if $y_t\gg 0$ for all $t$, and $y$ has a natural zero.

## Measures of forecast accuracy

\begin{block}{Mean Absolute Scaled Error}
$$
\text{MASE} = \text{mean}(|e_{T+h}|/Q)
$$
where $Q$ is a stable measure of the scale of the time series $\{y_t\}$.
\end{block}
Proposed by Hyndman and Koehler (IJF, 2006).

For non-seasonal time series,
$$
  Q = (T-1)^{-1}\sum_{t=2}^T |y_t-y_{t-1}|
$$
works well. Then MASE is equivalent to MAE relative to a naïve method.
