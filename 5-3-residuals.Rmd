## Fitted values

 - $\hat{y}_{t|t-1}$ is the forecast of $y_t$ based on observations $y_1,\dots,y_{t-1}$.
 - We call these "fitted values".
 - Sometimes drop the subscript: $\hat{y}_t \equiv \hat{y}_{t|t-1}$.
 - Often not true forecasts since parameters are estimated on all data.

### For example:

 - $\hat{y}_{t} = \bar{y}$ for average method.
 - $\hat{y}_{t} = y_{t-1} + (y_{T}-y_1)/(T-1)$ for drift method.

## Forecasting residuals

\begin{block}{}
\textbf{Residuals in forecasting:} difference between observed value and its fitted value: $e_t = y_t-\hat{y}_{t|t-1}$.
\end{block}

\alert{Assumptions}

  1. $\{e_t\}$ uncorrelated. If they aren't, then information left in  residuals that should be used in computing forecasts.
  2. $\{e_t\}$ have mean zero. If they don't, then forecasts are biased.

\alert{Useful properties} (for distributions & prediction intervals)

  3. $\{e_t\}$ have constant variance.
  4. $\{e_t\}$ are normally distributed.
