## Ex-ante versus ex-post forecasts

 * *Ex ante forecasts* are made using only information available in advance.
    - require forecasts of predictors
 * *Ex post forecasts* are made using later information on the predictors.
    - useful for studying behaviour of forecasting models.

 * trend, seasonal and calendar variables are all known in advance, so these don't need to be forecast.

## Scenario based forecasting

 * Assumes possible scenarios for the predictor variables
 * Prediction intervals for scenario based forecasts do not include the uncertainty associated with the future values of the predictor variables.

## Building a predictive regression model {-}

 * If getting forecasts of predictors is difficult, you can use lagged predictors instead.
$$y_{t}=\beta_0+\beta_1x_{1,t-h}+\dots+\beta_kx_{k,t-h}+\varepsilon_{t}$$

 * A different model for each forecast horizon $h$.

## US Consumption

```{r usconsumptionf, echo=TRUE}
fit_consBest <- us_change |>
  model(
    TSLM(Consumption ~ Income + Savings + Unemployment)
  )

future_scenarios <- scenarios(
  Increase = new_data(us_change, 4) |>
    mutate(Income = 1, Savings = 0.5, Unemployment = 0),
  Decrease = new_data(us_change, 4) |>
    mutate(Income = -1, Savings = -0.5, Unemployment = 0),
  names_to = "Scenario"
)

fc <- forecast(fit_consBest, new_data = future_scenarios)
```

## US Consumption

```{r usconsumptionf2, echo=TRUE}
us_change |> autoplot(Consumption) +
  labs(y = "% change in US consumption") +
  autolayer(fc) +
  labs(title = "US consumption", y = "% change")
```
