## Time series patterns

**Recall**

Trend
:  pattern exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data.

Cyclic
: pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are *not of fixed period* (duration usually of at least 2 years).

Seasonal
: pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the week).

## Time series decomposition

\begin{block}{}\vspace*{-0.3cm}
\[ y_t = f(S_t, T_t, R_t) \]
\end{block}
\begin{tabular}{@{}llp{8cm}@{}}
where & $y_t=$ & data at period $t$ \\
      & $T_t=$ & trend-cycle component at period $t$\\
      & $S_t=$ & seasonal component at period $t$ \\
      & $R_t=$ & remainder component at period $t$
\end{tabular}
\pause

**Additive decomposition:** $y_t = S_t + T_t + R_t.$

**Multiplicative decomposition:** $y_t = S_t \times T_t \times R_t.$

## Time series decomposition
\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

  *  Additive model  appropriate if  magnitude of  seasonal fluctuations does not vary with level.
  *  If seasonal are proportional to level of series, then multiplicative model appropriate.
  *  Multiplicative decomposition more prevalent with economic series
  *  Alternative: use a Box-Cox transformation, and then use additive decomposition.
  *  Logs turn multiplicative relationship into an additive relationship:

$$y_t = S_t \times T_t \times R_t \quad\Rightarrow\quad
\log y_t = \log S_t + \log T_t + \log R_t.

us_retail_employment <- us_employment |>
  filter(year(Month) >= 1990, Title == "Retail Trade") |>

us_retail_employment
```

  autoplot(Employed) +
  labs(y = "Persons (thousands)", title = "Total employment in US retail")

## Seasonal adjustment

  *  Useful by-product of decomposition:  an easy way to calculate seasonally adjusted data.
  *  Additive decomposition: seasonally adjusted data given by
$$y_t - S_t = T_t + R_t$$
  *  Multiplicative decomposition: seasonally adjusted data given by
$$y_t / S_t = T_t \times R_t$$

## US Retail Employment

```{r usretail-sa}
us_retail_employment |>
  autoplot(Employed, color = "gray") +
  autolayer(components(dcmp), season_adjust, color = "#0072B2") +
  labs(y = "Persons (thousands)", title = "Total employment in US retail")
```

## Seasonal adjustment

  * We use estimates of $S$ based on past values to seasonally adjust a current value.
  *  Seasonally adjusted series reflect **remainders** as well as **trend**. Therefore they are not "smooth" and "downturns" or "upturns" can be misleading.
  *  It is better to use the trend-cycle component to look for turning points.
