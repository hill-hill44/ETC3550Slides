## Seasonal plots

```{r, echo=TRUE, dependson="a10", fig.height=3.3}
a10 |> gg_season(Cost, labels = "both") +
  labs(y = "$ million", title = "Seasonal plot: antidiabetic drug sales")
```

## Seasonal plots

  * Data plotted against the individual "seasons" in which the data were observed.  (In this case a "season" is a month.)
  * Something like a time plot except that the data from each season are overlapped.
  * Enables the underlying seasonal pattern to be seen more clearly, and also allows any substantial departures from the seasonal pattern to be easily identified.
  * In R: `gg_season()`

## Quarterly Australian Beer Production

```{r fig.height=2.8}
beer <- aus_production |>
  select(Quarter, Beer) |>
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 1992)
beer |> autoplot(Beer)
```

## Quarterly Australian Beer Production

```{r}
beer |> gg_season(Beer, labels = "right")
```
