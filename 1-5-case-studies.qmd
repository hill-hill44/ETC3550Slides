## CASE STUDY 1: Paperware company

![](figs/tableware2.jpg){.wrapping #fig-structure width="20%"}
**Problem:** Want forecasts of each of hundreds of items. Series can be stationary, trended or seasonal. They currently have a large forecasting program written in-house but it doesn't seem to produce sensible forecasts. They want me to fix it.

<div style="clear:both;"></div>

**Additional information**

::: {.tightlist}

* Program written in COBOL making numerical calculations limited. It is not possible to do any optimisation.
* They employ no statisticians and want the program to produce forecasts automatically.

## CASE STUDY 1: Paperware company

### Methods currently used

A
: 12 month average

C
: 6 month average

E
: straight line regression over last 12 months

G
: straight line regression over last 6 months

H
: average slope between last year's and this year's values.
  (Equivalent to differencing at lag 12 and taking mean.)

I
: Same as H except over 6 months.

K
: I couldn't understand the explanation.

## CASE STUDY 2: PBS

## CASE STUDY 2: PBS

### The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) is the Australian government drugs subsidy scheme.

  * Many drugs bought from pharmacies are subsidised to allow more equitable access to modern drugs.
  * The cost to government is determined by the number and types of drugs purchased. Currently nearly 1\% of GDP.
  * The total cost is budgeted based on forecasts of drug usage.

## CASE STUDY 2: PBS

  * In 2001: \$4.5 billion budget, under-forecasted by \$800 million.
  * Thousands of products. Seasonal demand.
  * Subject to covert marketing, volatile products, uncontrollable expenditure.
  * Although monthly data available for 10 years, data are aggregated to annual values, and only the first three years are used in estimating the forecasts.
  * All forecasts being done with the \texttt{FORECAST} function in MS-Excel!

## CASE STUDY 3: Car fleet company

**Client:** One of Australia's largest car fleet companies

**Problem:** how to forecast resale value of vehicles? How
should this affect leasing and sales policies?

. . .

### Additional information
 - They can provide a large amount of data on previous vehicles and their eventual resale values.
 - The resale values are currently estimated by a group of specialists. They see me as a threat and do not cooperate.

## CASE STUDY 4: Airline

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

## CASE STUDY 4: Airline

**Problem:** how to forecast passenger traffic on major routes?

### Additional information

  * They can provide a large amount of data on previous routes.
  * Traffic is affected by school holidays, special events such as
the Grand Prix, advertising campaigns, competition behaviour, etc.
  * They have a highly capable team of people who are able to do
most of the computing.
